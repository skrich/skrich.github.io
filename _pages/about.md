Welcome! I'm a linguist, educator, researcher, and data analyst working on projects involving language comprehension, memory, and reading. I've just completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at Concordia University, and before then earned my Ph.D. in Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz in June 2024.
